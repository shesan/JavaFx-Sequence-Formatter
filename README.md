# JavaFx-Sequence-Formatter
JavaFx application.

Allows users to input a DNA/RNA sequence and change parameters on how you would like the sequence to be formatted. This is done to better visualize the sequence to be copied down or easily identify codons when "number of characters per line" is set to 3.
Paramaters include:
- Number of characters per string line
- Inclusion of spaces every 10 characters
- Inclusion of the starting base of each line
- Upper/Lowercase the sequence
