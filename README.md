# JavaFx-Sequence-Formatter
JavaFx application.

Allows users to input a DNA/RNA sequence and change parameters on how you would like the sequence to be formatted. 
This is done to better visualize the sequence to be copied down or easily identify codons when "number of characters per line" is set to 3.
Parameters include:
- Number of characters per string line
- Inclusion of spaces every 10 characters
- Inclusion of the starting base of each line
- Upper/Lowercase the sequence

Ability to save these parameters along with loading them is also built in so they could be reused at a later date.
